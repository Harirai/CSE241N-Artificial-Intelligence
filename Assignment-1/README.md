Assignment 1 - Sudoku solver
============================


### Assignment deadline: 19-01-2020 11:59 pm

In this sample assignment, you will implement how to solve a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. Now this is a classic example where you DO NOT need to implement an AI based algorithm to solve the puzzle. As the search space is limited, exhausitive algorithms like backtracking or CSP can solve the problem pretty simply.

In this assignment, you will implement backtracking. You are also required to look into and implement one more algorihm (e.g. CSP, as discussed in the lab or any other algorithm you may find) to solve this problem.

Files: 

* [assignment1.py](assignment1.py): This file contains the class object for the sudoku puzzle. You need to fill in the `solve` method of the "sudoku" class. Helper functions are in place to automatically read the data and write the solution into a file.

* [data.txt](data.txt): This contains a sample sudoku problem which needs to be solved using your algorithm. The 0 value entries need to be filled.

Files to be submitted:

* assignment1.py
* sol.txt: This will be automatically generated using your algorithm when you run assignment-0.py

**Note that your code will be run on other sample sudoku problems as well, so make sure to test your code thoroughly.**

We will also release a sample solution after you guys submit your solution!
